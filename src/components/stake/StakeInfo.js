        The Kaddex Staking tool accomplishes three main purposes: • Passive Income Source: stakers receive 0.05% from all swapping fees. Rewards
        re-staking (“Compounding”) is available once a week from the end of your waiting time.
        <br />• Users’ Empowerment: staking allows users to increase their DAO voting Power in a way that values long-term holders over whales. <br />
        • Deflation of KDX's overall supply: all the penalties coming from early unstaking are constantly burnt.
